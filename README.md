## Abstract
There are a _lot_ of MUDs. Most MUDs focus on itself. Lighthouse is different. Lighthouse
focuses on other MUDs. Using Lighthouse as a home for their extensive wandering, players
venture out into the wilderness and explore other MUDs together.

Lighthouse provides a simplistic MUX-style environment, MUD listings, and coordinates weekly
and monthly raids on obscure, or otherwise neglected MUDs.

As MUDders, we know that there are a lot of MUDs. Literally. Hundreds of them. But a common problem for the majority of MUDs is that there are very few or no players. Very often, if you look hard enough, you will find a hidden gem of a MUD, except nobody plays it anymore.

The goal of Lighthouse is coordinate player raids and spelunking. The community uses Lighthouse as a base, and it enables them to coordinate forays into the wilderness. Many MUDs are not very fun without other players playing alongside you, and for that reason, Lighthouse coordinates a special type of event called a raid. 

A raid is when the Lighthouse community join a new MUD and play together on it. By doing this at the same time, they recreate the atmosphere of the MUD back in the days when there were a lot more players, and they are enabled to relive the glories of the past. It is a rebirth.

Lighthouse coordinates raids on a monthly and weekly basis. MUDs chosen for a raid are randomly chosen, from a list submitted by participants of previous raids.
